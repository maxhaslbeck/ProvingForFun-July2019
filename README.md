# Summary of July 2019 Contest at Proving for Fun:

This repository contains a summary of the July 2019 Contest at ["Proving for Fun"](https://competition.isabelle.systems).

Here, we summarize what happend from begin to end of the contest, announce the winners here, and collect and discuss solutions. Feel free to send us pull requests with your solutions and discuss them in the respective issues.

## Chronology:

* 2019-07-05 17:13 - Contest starts with 4+1 Tasks and support for Isabelle and Coq
* After 3 hours - *eberlm* submits first overall solution for task **Special Pythagorean Triple** in Isabelle
* Shortly after - *eberlm* submits first overall solution for task **Fun modulo 5** in Isabelle
* Shortly after - *Azael* solves **Special Pythagorean Triple** and **Fun modulo 5** in Coq
* 5 hours into the contest - *eberlm* submits first correct solution for task **A Funky Grammar** in Isabelle
* 23 hours into the contest - *eberlm* submits the first correct solution for **XOR** in Isabelle, and thus has solved all 4 *solvable* tasks.
* Day 3 - *jonathye* submits the first Coq solution for **XOR** and later the same day the first Coq solution for **A Funky Grammar**, and thus is second to solve all *solvable* tasks
* Day 5 - the user named *j* has solved all four tasks in Coq
* Day 9 - *tahasaf* has solved all four tasks in Isabelle, as well as *Nitrate* did in Coq
* Day 13 - *lasydler* solved all 4 tasks in Coq
* Day 26 - *s-quark* and *aleksey* did all 4 tasks in Coq
* Day 26 - ACL2 and Lean enter the competition and *alexjbest* is the first to trick the system by solving **break the system** for Lean. Subsequently the loophole is closed, but the point is still valid to *alexjbest* and *chrishughes24*.
* Day 27 - The first correct Lean solutions start to come in: *alexjbest* is the first for **Special Pythagorean Triple** and *chrishughes24* for **Fun modulo 5**
* Day 28 - *monadius* solved all 4 tasks in Coq and also submits a correct solution in Lean, being the first to submit solutions in two ITPs. 
* After roughly a month - *lasydler*, *jonathye* and *monadius* use a known Coq bug to **break the system**. They thus overtake *eberlm* with now five solved tasks. Using a soundness bug is considered okay in that task, only in the first four tasks it is disqualified. 
* 2019-08-09 midnight - contest ends

## Winners and Awards:

*jonathye* wins the July Contest - congratulations!
The contestant is followed by *lasydler* and *monadius*, all three solving all four solvable tasks in Coq and additionally breaking our system.

*eberlm* and *tahasaf* solve all four tasks with Isabelle and result in placements 4 and 6.
The user *j* is 5th with solving problems with Coq.

The best Lean user were *alexejbest* shortly followed by *chrishughes24* with 3 solved tasks: both solving two tasks with Lean and tricking our system.

In total we had 33 participants, 18 using Coq, 12 using Isabelle, 5 using Lean, and 1 using ACL2.

*lasydler* and *monadius* even used two different proof assistants! :)
